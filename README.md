# InstallMonoGameLinuxScript
This script is for installing MonoGame on Linux.
## Why this script was written
To make it as easy as possible to install MonoGame on Linux and to have content building work right from the start.
## Installation
1. clone this repo
1. run the `install-monogame.sh` script
1. at the end of the installation two test projects (cornflower blue: template test project and monogame orange: content test project) are automatically started to verify everything works as it should (just close them manually when you see them)
